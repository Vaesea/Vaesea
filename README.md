# Hello!
I'm Vaesea.

## What do I work on?
I work on Tux Platforming and PepperTux. I also like the idea of making smaller projects so I might make smaller projects sometimes. I used to work on some old Dave And Bambi fan-mods but I don't anymore because I lost interest in FNF.

## What can I make?
I can make music, I can try make art (only small pixel art and (Old) SuperTux-style art) but it doesn't really end up looking that good.

## Other things to know
There is no other thing to know right now.
